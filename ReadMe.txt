If you are using command line to run my codes, go to the location where you unzip the file.
********************************************************
BTree:

1. Using "javac BtreeTest" to compile the BTreeTest.java file;
2. If there is no error, then type "java BTreeTest" to run the program;
3. After step 2, the command line will ask you to enter the order for the BTree, press enter button, the command line then will ask you to enter a number, this number is used to generate n random permutations range from 1 to n, then these permutations will be inserted into the BTree and the program will search for these keys in the inserted order;
4. you will see that the running time for insert operation and running time for search operation appear on the screen. 
5. This code will write out the sorted inserted numbers(get in the step 3) into a file named "BTreeSorted.txt", open the file, you will see the inserted numbers are sorted.
*********************************************************

BTreeHash:

1. Using "javac BtreeHash.java" to compile the BtreeHash.java file;
2. If there is no error, then type "java BtreeHash" to run the program;
3. After step 2, the command line will ask you to enter a number and the size of hash table, this number is used to generate n random permutations range from 1 to n, then these permutations will be inserted into the BTree and the program will search for these keys in the inserted order;the size of hash table is used to get the mode of key mode hashsize;
4. in the last step, you will see that the running time for insert operation and running time for search operation appear on the screen. 
*********************************************************

AVLTree:

1. Using "javac AVLTreeTest.java" to compile the AVLTreeTest.java file;
2. If there is no error, then type "java AVLTreeTest" to run the program;
3. After step 2, the command line will ask you to enter a number, this number is used to generate n random permutations range from 1 to n, then these permutations will be inserted into the BTree and the program will search for these keys in the inserted order;
4. you will see that the running time for insert operation and running time for search operation appear on the screen. 
5. This code will write out the inorder numbers(get in the step 3) into a file named "AVL_inorder.txt", it also write out the postorder numbers into a file named "AVL_postorder.txt". 
*********************************************************

AVLTreeHash:

1. Using "javac AVLTreeHash.java" to compile the AVLTreeHash.java file;
2. If there is no error, then type "java AVLTreeHash" to run the program;
3. After step 2, the command line will ask you to enter a number and the size of hash table, this number is used to generate n random permutations range from 1 to n, then these permutations will be inserted into the BTree and the program will search for these keys in the inserted order;the size of hash table is used to get the mode of key mode hashsize;
4. you will see that the running time for insert operation and running time for search operation appear on the screen. 
5. This code will write out the several treess' inorder numbers(get in the step 3) into a file named "AVLHash_inorder.txt". 
*********************************************************

TreeMap:
1. Using "javac TreeMapDemo.java" to compile the TreeMapDemo.java file;
2. If there is no error, then type "java TreeMapDemo" to run the program;
3. After step 2, the command line will ask you to enter a number, this number is used to generate n random permutations range from 1 to n, then these permutations will be inserted into the BTree and the program will search for these keys in the inserted order;
4. you will see that the running time for insert operation and running time for search operation appear on the screen.
